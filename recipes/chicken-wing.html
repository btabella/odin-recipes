    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing is more satisfying than cooking up a batch of wings without deep 
            frying. These extra crispy wings only need a light coating of cooking spray 
            on the air fryer basket. Then the magic happens: the air fryerâ€™s fan and 
            heating mechanism create a frenzy of forceful hot air that swirls down and 
            around the wings, crisping up the skin to golden perfection (and without the 
            added calories of frying oil)</p>
